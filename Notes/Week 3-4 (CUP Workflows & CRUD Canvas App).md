### TL;DR

- Built out full CUP workflow chart
- - Link to CUP workflow chart: [CUP Workflow Diagram](https://csulb.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/sites/CHHS-IT/Shared%20Documents/CUP/Angel%20Rough%20CUP%20Workflow.vsdx?d=wb7c4269761f14b93b18071ddf96fe378&csf=1&web=1&e=1jF72F)
- Continuing Canvas CRUD app development

### CUP Workflow Build-Out

- Created end-to-end CUP workflow diagram
- Mapped full lifecycle:
  - Eligibility (Microsoft List)
  - Chair Confirmation
  - Quote Process
  - Procurement Review
  - DPR Handling
  - Purchasing (PO creation)
  - Receiving & Inventory
  - Deployment

- Added decision branch:
  - Chair Denial → Status Closed

---

### Architecture Clarification

**Frontend**
- CHHS Storefront entry point

**Backend**
- Dataverse (CUP records)
- Microsoft List (Eligibility)

**Integration**
- Procurement system
- Inventory system

---

### Roles & Responsibilities Defined

- End User – submits / signs DPR
- Chair – confirms eligibility
- Coordinator – requests quotes
- Procurement – reviews quote + funding
- IT – receives + tags device
- System – logs, tracks, stores documents

---

### Automation Triggers Identified

- On eligibility check → notify Chair
- On Chair approval → notify Coordinator
- On Procurement approval → generate DPR
- On PO creation → log tracking
- On delivery → update inventory
- On deployment → close request

Goal: reduce email chains + manual tracking

### App Work

- Continuing Canvas CRUD app development
- Refining structure to align with CUP workflow
- Focus still on functionality > polish
